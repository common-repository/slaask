Your customer service app for Slack. Bring all your team -and client!- communication together in one place.

== Description ==

[Slaask](https://slaask.com) is the first customer chat tool that is 100% integrated into Slack.

With Slaask, you no longer need to use a separate customer chat tool outside of Slack.

Finally, your customer chat tool is fully integrated into Slack.

While reducing friction within your company operations, leverage Slack's features for your customers (search engine, fully native apps for iOS and Android...).

Slaask is for forward-thinking small and medium size businesses who believe in the "all your tools in one place" Slack vision.

Slaask.
Less tabs. Better reactivity. More conversions.
